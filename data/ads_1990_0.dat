It involves the study of the statistical properties of string networks and the dynamics of long strings, including the scaling density; the fractal nature of string substructure; and the effectiveness of the gravitational damping mechanism, regarding the long strings' wiggles. Methodologically, it employs both numerical--within the framework of an exact soluble model in flat spacetime--and analytical analyses. The central propositions of this research are as follows: (1) For a string network in equilibrium, when the energy density of the network is low, the dominant part of the string is in the form of closed loops of the smallest allowed size. At a certain critical density the system undergoes a phase transition characterized by formation of very long strings. (2) For an evolving network, the typical curvature radius of long strings, and the characteristic distance between them, are both comparable to the evolution time. At the same time, long strings possess a significant small-scale structure, which plays an important role in the energy distribution of the produced loops. (3) Gravitational radiation is rather effective in damping the small-scale structure, but only for large-amplitude waves.

Requires signed TDF. A new faint galaxy redshift survey has been constructed using the fibre optic coupler at the Anglo-Australian Observatory. Intermediate dispersion spectra with resolution ~4 A have been gathered for over 200 field galaxies selected in apparent magnitude slices between 20.0 < b<SUB>J</SUB>< 21.5 in 5 high latitude fields. Redshift completeness is 85% and the mean redshift agrees well from field to field. Models for the prediction of faint galaxy distributions are constructed from a bright galaxy redshift survey (Durham/Anglo -Australian Redshift Survey) and show that although the slope of the galaxy number-magnitude count relation is considerably steeper than no-evolution predictions at b <SUB>J</SUB>~ 21, the redshift range observed is similar to that expected for a non-evolving population. If our fields are representative, luminosity evolution can only be occurring in low luminosity galaxies to z < 0.5. The faint spectra reveal strong evidence for enhanced star formation in a large proportion of the galaxies beyond z ~ 0.1 which cannot be explained in terms of colour or aperture selection-effects. We suggest that it is these star-forming galaxies which represent the excess in the galaxy counts, at least in the range b<SUB>J</SUB>< 22. The colour and absorption line features of the stronger emission line galaxies can only be reproduced with models incorporating strong short-lived bursts of star formation which temporarily brighten these otherwise low-luminosity systems. We are able to reproduce these observations with a physical 'burst' model in which only galaxies at the faint end of the luminosity function significantly evolve via short (10^8yrs) bursts of star formation. These results are supported by model comparison with very faint colour distributions. We find good agreement with the no-evolution model in the range b_ {J} - R<SUB>f</SUB> > 1.6, indicating a minimum of evolution of bright early type galaxies. The excess number count is clearly concentrated blueward of this, and consistent with the expectation of the burst model.

The equations are applicable to molecular clouds and accretion disks and perhaps even galactic disks. In the most general case the two-dimensional formulation is time dependent, the gas is self-gravitating and non-ideal physical processes such as viscosity, heat conduction and radiative losses are incorporated. When the gas is taken to be ideal, it is shown that the effects of a passive halo may be included; further restricting the problem to be time independent allows inclusion of a central point-mass as well. For a steady-state, ideal gas analytic and uniform flow solutions are found for zero temperature disks controlled by a central mass and by a passive halo. Accretion solutions containing spiral-shaped shocks are found numerically for the case of a steady-state, ideal gas disk in a central potential. For these solutions, it is shown that increasing the adiabatic index results in more and weaker shocks. For the full time-dependent, viscous gas case periodic outflow solutions are found for which the derivative of the temperature is discontinuous at a spiral arm. The solutions with small pitch angles have pattern speeds greater than the gas speed and display relatively small, smooth variations. In the case of larger pitch angles, the gas flows more rapidly than the pattern and solutions reminiscent of shocks are found.

Experimental observations with ISEE 1 have hinted that the flow has a stagnation point, but have not been conclusive. The present study, using data from the AMPTE/CCE spacecraft, attempts to determine experimentally whether the magnetosheath bulk flow has a stagnation point or a stagnation line configuration. The AMPTE/CCE spacecraft has an equatorial orbit with an apogee of 8.8 R_{rm e}. During compressions of the magnetosphere, it enters the subsolar magnetosheath, sometimes for several hours. This is an ideal situation to observe the flow configuration because the spacecraft is at rest, or nearly so, in the subsolar region. The CHEM instrument can detect ions from 1 to 300 keV/e in approximately the YZ GSE plane, the plane parallel to the magnetopause. Near the subsolar region, most of the bulk flow speed is in this plane. The H ^+ and He^{++} ions are found to be flowing in the same direction. The calculated speed of the He^{++} is approximately 20% lower than that of the H ^+ on average, although this may be a computational artifact. The bulk flow direction was compared to the theoretical flow direction predictions for a stagnation point and a stagnation line. It was found that 36% of the time intervals were consistent with the theory of a stagnation point, while 24% of the intervals were consistent with the theory of a stagnation line. The hourly average interplanetary magnetic field from the IMP 8 spacecraft was examined during the orbits for which it was available. For orbits with a significant number (>4) of stagnation point-like intervals, the IMF was either northward or unmeasured.

Two observing projects were undertaken: the first, a sensitive 21 cm. survey of massive early type disk galaxies done with the 300 m. Arecibo radio telescope; and the second, a CCD photometric study of B and R images of galaxies from the H I survey and from the three density regimes. The resulting surface brightness profiles were deconvolved into bulge and disk components where possible. The parameters derived from these projects were analyzed in the context of the parallel sequence system which classifies disk galaxies according to their bulge-to-total light ratio (B/T) (horizontally) and their disk structure (vertically). Although the Arecibo H I survey detected 48% of the SO's, 73% of the SOa's and 96% of the Sa's, few, if any, gas-rich galaxies would have gone undetected due to the inability of a 10 MHz bandwidth to detect a wide velocity spectral profile. A comparison of a hybrid, distance-independent H I surface density (M_{rm HI }/D_{rm opt} ^2) showed that the values for SO galaxies ranged continuously from amounts equivalent to those found in Sa's and Sb's, (10^9-10 <SUP>10</SUP> solar masses) to low upper limits (<10^7 solar masses). The vertical axis of the classification system can thus be identified with a gradation in the neutral gas content, as well as with decreasing evidence of star formation activity. The variation of gas and structural properties along this axis is consistent with the evolution of Sa galaxies into SO's due only to astration. Although we find no strong evidence to support an environmental enhancement of this evolution, the distributions of B/T, total colors, disk colors, and (bulge-disk) colors are not inconsistent with a picture in which star formation in the Coma cluster galaxies ceased some time in the past whereas the SO disks in isolated environments have experienced a variety of star formation histories.", "bibstem": ["PhDT", "PhDT"], "citation_count": 6, "pub": "Ph.D. Thesis", "[citations]": {"num_citations": 6, "num_references": 0}, "keyword_schema": ["STI category"], "keyword_norm": ["Physics: Astronomy and Astrophysics"], "year": "1990", "identifier": ["1990PhDT........14E"], "title": ["S Galaxies: Their Gas Content, Structure and Environment"], "property": ["REFEREED", "PHDTHESIS"], "id": "3595390", "pubdate": "1990-09-00", "aff": ["Yale University."]}, {"bibcode": "1990PhDT........14C", "author": ["Croswell, Ken"], "keyword": ["STELLAR POPULATIONS", "Physics: Astronomy and Astrophysics", "A Stars", "Astronomical Photometry", "Halos", "Milky Way Galaxy", "Stellar Motions", "Stellar Spectra", "Bias", "Kinematics", "Luminosity", "Metallicity", "Stellar Luminosity", "Velocity Distribution", "Astronomy"], "database": ["ASTRONOMY"], "abstract": "I have observed 247 faint (13.3 mag. < V < 17.9 mag.) stars with B-V <=q 1.00 in one square degree near the North Galactic Pole.

This same type of phenomenon is believed to occur in the reversed field pinch (RFP) plasmas. The RFP dynamo has been a major theoretical and experimental investigation since the first observations of the self-reversal process in early pinch research. A discrete dynamo event has been observed in the experimental RFP plasmas; this event is termed the RFP sawtooth. This phenomenon is similar to the sawtooth phenomenon observed in tokamak plasmas, but the two events differ in many respects. Both events are a result of the inward diffusion of the plasma current density. This causes the plasma to become unstable to the m = 1 tearing modes. It has been shown theoretically that the nonlinear interaction of these modes can generate the reversed toroidal field in the RFP. This thesis is a study of the RFP sawtooth phenomenon on the MST RFP. This includes experimental observations as well as 1-D numerical simulations of the sawtooth rise-time. During the rise-time of the sawtooth, the plasma is undergoing a purely diffusive process - no dynamo is occurring during this phase. The dynamo only occurs during the sawtooth crash. During the rise-time, the m = 1 modes are observed to grow, and nonlinear interactions are observed prior to the sawtooth crash. At the time of the crash, many of the plasma profiles are flattened; these include the current density, the plasma temperature and the plasma density.

It appears that gravitational thermodynamic theory may not account for the accuracy of Saslaw and Hamilton's formula, as found numerically by N-body simulations. The intriguing problem of why the formula is so accurate is at least partially resolved by showing that the formula is consistent with all the relevant predictions of gravitational clustering theory. Comparison of the formula with the observations suggests that galaxy clustering is mainly an inevitable consequence of gravitational instability occurring in a statistically homogeneous and isotropic gravitating system started with a zero or small peculiar velocity field and a random or nearly random spatial distribution of galaxies. Saslaw and Hamilton's formula has also been reported to be sufficient for describing counts of galaxy clusters in cells.

The disturbance is attributed to the vehicle passage in and out of the Earth's umbra. During penumbral transitions, large flexible appendages undergo thermally induced bending caused by rapidly changing thermal conditions. Flexible structures, in particular solar arrays, experience rapid cooling during entrance and rapid heating at exit. TES has been observed during normal on-orbit operations of the LANDSAT-4 spacecraft, the Communications Technology Satellite and the Hubble Space Telescope. The fundamental equations used to model the TES disturbance torque for typical spacecraft appendages (e.g. solar arrays and antenna booms) are derived in detail. The time rates of change of the thermal gradient are shown to be the driving force behind estimating the TES disturbance torque. In order to predict the thermal response of a typical satellite solar array, a detailed thermal model is developed. The TOPEX spacecraft, designed using LANDSAT heritage, is selected to demonstrate the extensive thermo-mechanical modeling of the TES disturbance. In particular, the attitude pointing performance of the TOPEX spacecraft, when subjected to the TES disturbance, is analyzed using a three-axis, non-linear, time-domain simulation. Results indicate that the TOPEX spacecraft will exceed its roll axis attitude control requirement during prenumbral transitions, and remain in violation for approximately 150 sec each orbit until the umbra collapses. Fortunately, the attitude deviations are not large enough to cause the primary science instrument, a radar altimeter, to break lock, which would result in temporary loss of data. A localized active control system is proposed as a solution to minimize and/or eliminate the degrading effects of the TES disturbance. The feasibility of the control system is demonstrated by including it as part of a TOPEX vehicle design and re-evaluating the attitude pointing performance using the numerical simulation.

Des observations spectrophotometriques a grande echelle, ont ete obtenues pour 130 et 160 regions HII des spirales NGC628 (M74) et NGC6946, au telescope de 1,6m de l'Observatoire du mont Megantic. La methode d'imagerie monochromatique, realisee a l'aide de filtres interferentiels a bande passante etroite (Deltalambda ~ 1,0 nm), a permis d'integrer les flux dans les raies spectrales H\u03b1, H\u03b2, (OIII) (lambda 500,7 nm) et (NII) (lambda658,4 nm). Les abondances O/H et les gradients d'abondance, furent determines a l'aide de la calibration semi-empirique de Edmunds & Pagel (1984) et des mesures (OIII) /H beta dans les regions HII observees.

Most of these sources are entries, with small or unknown angular diameters, in the Perek and Kohoutek (1967) Catalogue of planetary nebulae. One hundred and fourteen of these program sources were detected with the Very Large Array radio telescope, and intensity contour plots, radio flux densities at 5 GHz, diameters, and accurate positions are presented for these objects. For each of the 174 program sources I extract, from the IRAS Point Source Catalog, the four photometric flux densities and derive the total infrared flux, a dust temperature, and the infrared excess. The survey leads to the identification of a large number of high surface brightness objects which are likely candidates for very young planetary nebulae. Three dimensional modelling of the two dimensional brightness distributions show that most of the survey detections can be reproduced reasonably well by a thin, prolate, ellipsoidal shell seen in projection. In terms of this model, the morphologies of planetary nebulae with larger angular diameters and lower surface brightness temperatures are similar to the survey objects. This indicates that the shapes of planetary nebulae do not change appreciably as the surface brightness decreases (with age). The survey detections are unique among the general population of planetary nebulae primarily because of their high 5 GHz brightness temperature. Examinations of other distant independent characteristics (derived using available data), reveal that all of the surface brightness quantities are strongly correlated to each other, while all other correlations are very low. However, significant differences (statistically) do exist between these objects and the general population in a number of distant independent parameters: infrared excess, IRAS colour group, infrared colour temperature, extinction coefficient, and galactic position. In terms of these parameters, the characteristics of the survey detections seem to be typical of other high surface brightness planetary nebulae. A subgroup of 20 of the brighter, poorly resolved objects were reobserved at 15 GHz in order to obtain higher spatial resolution. One of these objects, K3-35, shows an atypical morphology. It was examined in the 1612 GHz OH maser line and at other continuum radio frequencies.

The two main results of the integrated polarization analysis are; (1) For radio galaxies of low redshift (z< 0.5), the high-powered sources tend to possess a lower degree of polarization than the low-powered sources. (2) For radio galaxies at high redshifts (z> 0.5), the degree of polarization is larger than that observed in low redshift sources of the same luminosity.

Large-scale depolarization is attributed to either external rotation by a clumpy thermal plasma surrounding the source, or internal rotation with very small pathlengths. Thermal plasma densities based on random rotation was found to exceed 10^ {-3} cm^{-3} .

One use for which tethers are particularly well suited is to provide an isolated platform for spaceborne observatories. The advantages of tethering a pointing platform 1 or 2 km from a space shuttle or space station are that, compared to placing the observatory on the parent spacecraft, vibrational disturbances are attenuated and contamination is eliminated. In practice, all satellites have some requirement on the attitude control of the spacecraft, and tethered satellites are no exception. It has previously been shown that conventional means of performing attitude control for tethered satellites are insufficient for any mission with pointing requirements more stringent than about 1 deg. This is due mainly to the relatively large force applied by the tether to the spacecraft. A particularly effective method of implementing attitude control for tethered satellites is to use this tether tension force to generate control torques by moving the tether attach point relative to the subsatellite center of mass. A demonstration of this attitude control technique on an astrophysical pointing platform has been proposed for a space shuttle flight test project and is referred to as the Kinetic Isolation Tether Experiment (KITE).", "bibstem": ["PhDT", "PhDT"], "pub": "Ph.D. Thesis", "[citations]": {"num_citations": 0, "num_references": 0}, "keyword_schema": ["NASA/STI", "NASA/STI", "NASA/STI", "NASA/STI", "NASA/STI", "NASA/STI", "NASA/STI", "NASA/STI", "NASA/STI", "NASA/STI", "STI category"], "keyword_norm": ["Center Of Mass", "Control Systems Design", "Pointing Control Systems", "Satellite Attitude Control", "Tethered Satellites", "Tethering", "Spaceborne Telescopes", "Spacecraft Contamination", "Tetherlines", "Vibration Damping", "Spacecraft Design, Testing and Performance"], "year": "1990", "identifier": ["1990PhDT........60K"], "title": ["Precision tethered satellite attitude control"], "property": ["REFEREED", "PHDTHESIS"], "id": "3599512", "pubdate": "1990-03-00", "aff": ["Stanford Univ., CA."]}, {"bibcode": "1990PhDT........20S", "author": ["Schubnell, Michael"], "keyword": ["Cosmic Rays", "Energy Levels", "Isotropy", "Radiation Detectors", "Deviation", "Energy Dissipation", "Muons", "Point Sources", "Resolution", "Space Radiation"], "database": ["ASTRONOMY"], "abstract": "The complete muon data from the Frejus underground detector recorded during years 1984 to 1988 are analyzed.

The galactic center was observed in the J = 1 to 0 transition lines of H^{13 }CN and HCO^+ with the BIMA array at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory, with a spatial resolution of 5^{'' }, corresponding to 0.2 pc, and spectral resolution of 4 km s^{-1}.

Astrometry, photometry and morphological classifications are derived from CCD images for all 463 galaxies in Hickson's sample of 100 compact groups. Some minor revisions to the membership of the original catalog are made. At high galactic latitude (b > 30^circ), the catalog is estimated to be 90% complete for groups with total B_ T magnitude 13.0 or less. 49% of all the catalogued galaxies, and 48% of first -ranked galaxies are spiral. No significant difference is found between the distribution of morphological types of first-ranked galaxies and all group galaxies. Morphological concordance occurs among galaxies within a group: more galaxies are the same type (spiral or nonspiral), than would be expected by chance. Galaxy morphological type correlates with group optical luminosity and, more strongly, with velocity dispersion, but not with galaxy space density. These results imply that the morphological types of galaxies in compact groups are strongly influenced by the environment, and that this influence occurs mostly at the time of galaxy formation. Fields surrounding 97 compact groups with known redshifts were examined on the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey prints. 3889 galaxies were identified within 1.125h ^{-1} Mpc of the centre of each group. Coordinates, magnitudes, diameters, and Hubble types are derived for these galaxies. 78% of the groups show no significant excess of field galaxies within 0.5h^{-1} Mpc. This indicates that most compact groups are truly isolated. 59% of these field galaxies were classified as spiral, a higher fraction than for the group galaxies. This difference is more pronounced for groups which do show a significant field galaxy excess. These results indicate that most groups are dense dynamical entities. Monte-Carlo calculations indicate that typically 35% of all compact galaxy quintets should contain a single discordant redshift due to the chance alignment of an unrelated field galaxy. This is in agreement with the observed number of four discordant quintets in 10.

This thesis describes the development and evaluation of a number of new TEM-based techniques for the measurement of composition in ternary III-V and II-VI semiconductors. New methods of polarity determination in binary and ternary compounds are also presented. The theory of high energy electron diffraction is outlined, with particular emphasis on zone axis diffraction from well-defined strings. An account of TEM microstructural studies of Cd_{rm x}Hg _{rm 1-x}Te and CdTe epitaxial layers, which provided the impetus for developing the diffraction-based analytical techniques, is given. The wide range of TEM-based compositional determination techniques is described. The use of HOLZ deficiency lines to infer composition from a lattice parameter measurement is evaluated. In the case of Cd_{ rm x}Hg_{rm 1-x}Te, it is found to be inferior to other techniques developed. Studies of dynamical aspects of HOLZ diffraction can yield information about the dispersion surface from which a measure of composition may be obtained. This technique is evaluated for Al_{rm x}Ga_{rm 1-x} As, in which it is found to be of some use, and for Cd_{rm x}Hg _{rm 1-x}Te, in which the large Debye-Waller factor associated with mercury in discovered to render the method of little value. A number of critical voltages may be measured in medium voltage TEMs. The (111) zone axis critical voltage of Cd_{rm x}Hg _{rm 1-x}Te is found to vary significantly with x and forms the basis of an accurate technique for composition measurement in that ternary compound. Other critical voltage phenomena are investigated. In Al _{rm x}Ga_ {rm 1-x}As and other light ternaries, a non-systematic critical voltage is found to vary with x, providing a good indicator of composition. Critical voltage measurements may be made by conventional CBED or by various other techniques, which may also simultaneously yield information on the spatial variation of composition. The use of diffraction contrast imaging, large angle CBED and convergent beam imaging is evaluated and shown to have some advantages for flat samples. In studies of growth mechanisms, microstructures and even macroscopic properties, knowledge of the polarity of a zincblende structure crystal may be valuable.

Various aspects of an ultrashort pulse CDMA system were studied both theoretically and experimentally. Such a system employs a grating-telescope apparatus to encode the phase of every data bit by additional information, such as the destination address. At the receiving end a similar device decodes the encrypted phase, and forwards the information to the correct address. The results presented here also have more general applications than a CDMA system, but this approach provided a unifying framework for this study. Below is a brief summary of the major contributions described in the dissertation. For the purposes of experimental demonstrations, a tunable mode-locked laser, generating 100 fsec pulses, was developed. It operates around 1550 nm, which is the zero second-order dispersion wavelength of standard dispersion -shifted fibers. With this laser I was able to experimentally demonstrate for the first time third-order dispersion effects in the fiber. Simultaneous compensation of both second and third order dispersion of more than 3 km of fiber was demonstrated with a grating-pair-telescope apparatus. An expression for the fourth order grating dispersion is presented, and partially verified-experimentally. It is shown that fourth order grating dispersion can become important for compensation of pulses shorter than 200 fsec. The interaction of nonlinear effects combined with dispersion ans loss in the fiber was studied numerically. It is shown, that operating in the anomalous dispersion regime of the fiber extends the maximum transmission distance. It is also shown that increasing the peak input power beyond tens of milliwatts is detrimental, if it does not sustain a soliton. The exact power level to maximize the distance -bandwidth product depends on several other factors, that are discussed in detail. A general theory for the beam propagation through a grating-telescope phase encoder is presented, and its predictions were verified experimentally. Powerful engineering models was extracted from the general theory enabling simple calculations to estimate the encoder performance. Finally, a detailed derivation of the Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation that includes third order dispersion is presented from first principles.", "bibstem": ["PhDT", "PhDT"], "citation_count": 3, "pub": "Ph.D. Thesis", "[citations]": {"num_citations": 3, "num_references": 0}, "keyword_schema": ["STI category"], "keyword_norm": ["Engineering: Electronics and Electrical; Physics: Optics"], "year": "1990", "identifier": ["1990PhDT.......322S"], "title": ["Ultrashort Pulses in Fiber-Optic Communications."], "property": ["REFEREED", "PHDTHESIS"], "id": "3605863", "pubdate": "1990-00-00", "aff": ["COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY."]}, {"bibcode": "1990PhDT.......276M", "author": ["M\u00f6ller, R.

Astronomy in the hard X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum (20-250 keV) provides an essential insight into some of the most energetic processes occurring both in our galaxy and beyond. The current status of hard X-ray astronomy is reviewed, and conclusions concerning the required performance of the next generation of imaging telescopes are reached. Imaging in this waveband is made difficult by the penetrating nature of the X-ray photons, which makes the use of conventional optics impossible. The techniques applicable to hard X-ray imaging are reviewed, with the emphasis being placed upon modulation imaging in which specially designed apertures are used to modulate the incoming source flux according to the position of the source within the field of view. Hard X-ray detection techniques suitable for use with modulation imagers are reviewed. The recent development of position-sensitive photomultipliers, which are now available in a variety of configurations, has created a new possibility for the construction of hard X-ray detectors with the spatial resolution necessary to achieve the goal of arc minute imaging with a coded aperture imaging system. One particular type of position-sensitive photomultiplier has been evaluated in conjunction with a thin NaI(Tl) scintillation crystal to examine its potential in a number of X-ray imaging roles. The basic performance of the photomultiplier is assessed, and a method for using such a detector as a hard X-ray imager is developed. The intrinsic imaging capability of the detector may be relevant in applications where a relatively small detection area is sufficient, but for use in hard X-ray astronomy where the source flux is dominated by the background, a much larger detection area is essential. Methods for constructing large area detectors using position-sensitive photomultipliers are considered, as is the possibility of a position-sensitive phoswich based on the same techniques.

Low Rossby and Ekman numbers, 0.1 and 10^{-5} respectively, were achieved while maintaining large Reynolds number (greater than 10^4). The apparatus had a flat lid and conical bottom (slope s = -0.1) to mimic the planetary beta-effect. Motion was forced with six source-sink pairs, distributed symmetrically in a ring in the bottom of the tank. Two primary flow states were studied: marginally stable westward and eastward jets. Westward jets tended to be wide, and developed a central region of strong shear with quasi-uniform potential vorticity. Elliptical vortices of the same sign as the shear always formed. Due to design limitations, only cyclonic vortices were produced. Multiple vortex states were found for relatively narrow jets when the inertial time scale was comparable to the Ekman time scale. At increasingly shorter inertial time scale, produced with stronger forcing, the number of vortices decreased from a maximum of 5 to 1. The multiple vortex states were essentially laminar, inspite of their high Reynolds number; the single vortex state was turbulent, producing many small vortices that merged with the main vortex. The broad region of quasi -uniform potential vorticity was considered necessary for the formation of a single robust vortex. These vortices had many properties in common with vortices found on the large gaseous planets. Eastward jets tended to be narrow and exhibited Rossby wave instability. The number of waves was fairly well predicted by linear theory, except for the low forcing situation, when the pumping geometry strongly influenced the instability. Potential vorticity was quasi-uniform on either side of the jet, with a strong gradient in the jet center. This gradient was a strong barrier to particle transport. A Hamiltonian model of the flow demonstrated the presence of a robust invariant surface at the jet center, with large chaotic seas on either side.

The ground state rotational structure of the transition metal hydrides CuH, CrH, FeH, and CoH has been examined by two different far-infrared techniques: coherent tunable spectroscopy and laser magnetic resonance. The analysis of CuH (X^1Sigma ^+) was straightforward, and the rotational constants B, D, and H, and transition frequencies were determined to high precision. The analyses of CrH, CoH, and FeH were progressively more difficult. A complete least-squares fit of 468 CrH X^6Sigma magnetic resonance lines has yielded accurate g -factors and rotational molecular constants, including a much more accurate proton hyperfine splitting constant than was previously known. The analysis of 500 magnetic resonance lines from CoH allowed calculation of the magnetic g-factors, which confirm that the ground state is ^3Phi _4. Although the analysis also revealed perturbations of the ground electronic state by other low -lying electronic states, it was still possible to determine the molecular parameters. The results from the study of CuH, CrH, and CoH will be useful especially to theorists testing and refining ab initio calculations for the transition metal hydrides. The rotational transition frequencies of FeH in the ^4Delta electronic state were determined by magnetic resonance experiments. The ground rotational state transition frequency was determined to be 1 411 092.7 MHz. The precision of this frequency permits the radio-astronomical search for FeH in intersteller gas clouds.

Simulations from a comprehensive general circulation model were analyzed to provide realistic basic state and forcing. A quasi-geostrophic and a primitive -equation model were constructed. The models were found to give very different results when the Rossby number of the mean flow is large (around 0.4). The quasi-geostrophic model tends to give larger amplitude and longer vertical wavelength than the primitive-equation model. The wind shear and curvature of the basic state were found to play dominant roles in determining the refractive properties for wave propagation and wave structures in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere. The polar-night jet acts like a wave guide which allows waves to propagate to high altitudes. The forcing at the lower boundary has a smaller effect on the response away from the lower boundary. The linear response to tropospheric forcing was also found to be sensitive to the method of parameterization of Rayleigh friction near the critical lines. It is less sensitive to the background dissipation and the static stability parameters. When the linear solutions were compared to the planetary waves simulated by the general circulation model, certain discrepancies were found. The linear model can generally reproduce the location of maximum amplitude response and phase structure successfully, but tends to underestimate the wave amplitude.

The total mass of molecular hydrogen in this region is 3.4x10[superscript 7] M[...], roughly twice the mass in atomic hydrogen. The predicted atomic hydrogen column density from atomic mantles of molecular clouds is similar to the observed mean atomic hydrogen column density. Thus probably only a small fraction of the atomic hydrogen is in a diffuse component not directly associated with molecular clouds.The properties of 38 individual molecular clouds in M33 (velocity widths, diameters, peak brightness temperatures, and masses) are very similar to those of Galactic molecular clouds. Masses derived from the virial theorem and from the integrated CO fluxes agree to within 10%, which implies that the value of the conversion factor from CO flux to H[subscript 2] column density, \u03b1, is the same in M33 and the Galaxy. This is the first direct measurement of the value of \u03b1 in an external galaxy.The mass distribution of clouds in M33 is consistent with that derived in the Galaxy for M = 0.8 - 4 x 10[superscript 5] M[...], but shows a total lack of clouds with masses greater than 4 x 10[superscript 5] M[...]. A simple model is proposed to explain the high-mass cutoff to the mass distribution as arising from the competing processes of cloud growth through accretion and cloud destruction due to star formation. Comparison of the flux detected with the interferometer with single dish data indicates that 50% of the molecular gas resides in structures less massive than 0.8 x10[superscript 5] M[...], in contrast to the Galaxy where only 15% of the molecular gas mass is in these smaller structures.41 OB associations each containing at least ten blue stars have been identified in this region of M33. The associations have mean radii of 40 pc, masses in stars of mass > 20 M[...] of 600 M[...], and ages of 8x10[superscript 6] yr. No evidence is found for a gradient in the ratio of blue to red supergiants in the inner two kiloparsecs of M33, despite a factor of two decrease in the metallicity over this range of radius. The blue luminosity function for stars in the field is deficient at bright magnitudes relative to the luminosity function for stars in associations. In addition, the associations in the northern arm contain no stars more massive than 20 M[...] while associations in the southern arm contain several stars with masses of 60 M[...]. These differences may be due to a sudden cessation of star formation resulting in a larger mean age for the stars or to a smaller upper mass cutoff to the initial mass function in the field and the northern arm.The offset between the molecular and atomic gas peaks in the southern spiral arm is consistent with streaming motions expected as the gas enters a spiral density wave. In addition, the OB associations in the southern spiral arm show a weak age gradient perpendicular to the arm, consistent with the presence of a density wave. However, the northern arm has an age gradient running along the arm, as would be expected for a stochastic star formation arm.A comparison of the spatial distributions of the H\u03b1, CO, and HI emission peaks indicates that the atomic gas is probably formed via photo-dissociation of the molecular gas by recent high-mass star formation. Roughly two-thirds of the molecular clouds with M > 0.5 x 10[superscript 5] M[...] contain recent massive star formation with inferred high-mass star formation rates for individual clouds ranging from 5x10[superscript -6] to 5x10[superscript -4] M[...] yr[superscript -1]. The photo-dissociating flux produced by these stars is sufficient to produce the amount of atomic gas near the molecular clouds if the molecular clouds have a clumped structure.The high-mass star formation rate and efficiency are measured by combining optical, far-infrared, and millimeter data. The high-mass star formation rate calculated from the H\u03b1 emission is 0.007 M[...] yr[superscript -1] over an area of 5 kpc[superscript 2], which corresponds to a total star formation rate of 0.04 M[...] yr[superscript -1]. The star formation rate obtained from the far-infrared emission agrees with the rate obtained from the H\u03b1 emission to within a factor of two. A lower limit to the high-mass star formation rate obtained from number counts of blue stars is consistent with the rates obtained from H\u03b1 and far-infrared emission. The southern spiral arm and the molecular complexes have similar star formation efficiencies to regions of the galaxy containing little molecular gas. Thus the large amount of star formation occurring in the spiral arms of M33 is due to the presence of large amounts of molecular gas and not to an increased star formation efficiency.", "bibstem": ["PhDT", "PhDT"], "citation_count": 0, "pub": "Ph.D. Thesis", "[citations]": {"num_citations": 0, "num_references": 0}, "property": ["REFEREED", "PHDTHESIS"], "year": "1990", "title": ["Star formation and the interstellar medium in M33"], "identifier": ["1990PhDT.......184W"], "id": "3604369", "pubdate": "1990-01-00", "aff": ["California Institute of Technology"]}, {"bibcode": "1990PhDT.......183B", "author": ["Beckstead, Jeffrey Andrew"], "keyword": ["PLASMA", "plasmas", "Physics: Fluid and Plasma"], "database": ["ASTRONOMY"], "abstract": "A dynamo mechanism has been used in astrophysics to explain the self-generation of the magnetic fields observed throughout the universe. This same type of phenomenon is believed to occur in the reversed field pinch (RFP) plasmas. The RFP dynamo has been a major theoretical and experimental investigation since the first observations of the self-reversal process in the early pinch research. A discrete dynamo event has been observed in the experimental RFP plasmas; this event is termed the RFP sawtooth. This phenomenon is similar to the sawtooth phenomenon observed in tokamak plasmas, but the two events differ in many respects. Both events are a result of the inward diffusion of the plasma current density. This radial diffusion peaks the current profiles causing the plasma to become unstable to the m = 1 tearing modes. In the tokamak, it is the (m,n) = (1,1) mode while in the RFP, several m = 1 modes can become unstable with the n spectra dominated by the n ~ 2R/a mode. It has been shown theoretically that the nonlinear interaction of these modes can generate the reversed toroidal field in the RFP. During the rise-phase of the sawtooth, the plasma is undergoing a purely diffusive process--no dynamo is occurring during this phase. The dynamo only occurs during the sawtooth crash. During the rise-phase, the m = 1 modes are observed to grow, and nonlinear interactions are observed prior to the sawtooth crash. At the time of the crash, many of the plasma profiles are flattened; these include the current density, the plasma temperature and the plasma density. The flattening of these profiles restabilizes the plasma to the m = 1 tearing modes. This thesis is a study of the RFP sawtooth phenomenon on the MST RFP.

The past orbits of the Magellanic Clouds are modelled. A tidal encounter between the LMC and SMC has almost certainly occurred within the last 10<SUP>9</SUP> years. The observed structure of the Magellanic System supports this hypothesis and so it is accepted. This encounter event is found to be crucial to the understanding of the Magellanic System. Ca II absorption spectra of 25 Magellanic Cloud supergiants have been obtained at a resolution of 5 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> using the Anglo-Australian Telescope. They are used with new H I observations from the Parkes radio telescope to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Radio continuum polarization maps of the LMC and SMC have been obtained at 2.3, 4.75 and 8.55 GHz using the Parkes telescope. They complement the optical polarization measurements in revelation of the magnetic field structure of the Magellanic Clouds. The gas in both Magellanic Clouds is seen to have a distance-velocity association. This breaks down south of 30 Doradus where the gas structure is complex. The radio and optical polarization measurements are seen to agree, indicating no significant line-of-sight structure to the aligned magnetic field in either the LMC or SMC. The pan-Magellanic field originally proposed by Mathewson and Ford finds support, and a clearly revealed spiral field centred on 30 Doradus merges smoothly with it. The Parkes telescope has been used to obtain finely gridded H I measurements of the Magellanic Stream and the high velocity H I around the Magellanic System. The origin of the intermediate velocity gas components seen in the direction of the LMC is finally determined. The Magellanic Stream is found to be bifurcated along its entire length with many anomalous velocity H I clouds alongside. A two component profile is discovered in the tip of the Stream indicating that nearby the extreme velocity clouds are part of the Stream. The high velocity clouds (HVCs) ahead of the Magellanic Stream are found to be part of a halo HVC population. The diffuse ram pressure origin of the Magellanic Stream is modelled. The origin of the Magellanic Stream is found to be the collision of a multi-phase halo (made up of the halo HVCs and diffuse corona) with the Inter-Cloud region.

We were able to adjust the two electrical bridge resonant frequencies on top of each other at the pump frequency, allowing us to obtain an electromechanical coupling as high as 0.054. This high coupling, corresponding to an rms electric field strength of 1.79 times 10^5 V/m across the capacitor plates, is the highest measured so far for this class of transducers. In one case, we observed a dip in the electrical noise spectrum near the mechanical resonant frequency due to destructive interference between this noise and its \"reflection\" from the mechanical resonator. At the bottom of this dip, we measured, for this transducer, an equivalent displacement noise of 4 times 10 ^{-16} m/sqrt {rm Hz} with a systematic error of less than 10%. This measured equivalent displacement noise allows this parametric transducer to detect accelerations of 1.4 times 10^{-8 } m/s^2 at 929 Hz in a one Hz bandwidth.

In high-inclination systems, standard theory predicts that one should observe double-peaked emission line profiles which are eclipsed once every orbital period. However, the emission lines of eclipsing quiescent novae are single-peaked and uneclipsed, in obvious conflict with currently held beliefs on the nature of these systems. It is the purpose of this thesis to solve this long-standing problem and so arrive at a theoretical model for quiescent novae which is consistent with the observational evidence. The first part of the thesis sets the scene to the problem by presenting an overview of the conflicting observational and theoretical results. The second part then reports on a number of new observations obtained during the course of this work which have shed new light on the problem. The results of these new observations are presented in Part III of the thesis, where one chapter is devoted to each of the three objects studied (V1315 Aquilae, SW Sextantis and DW Ursae Majoris). The final part of the thesis is a discussion and comparison of the various results presented in Part III. Using these results, a series of observational constraints are defined which are then applied to a number of existing theoretical models. In the case of V1315 Aql and SW Sex, the very stringent set of constraints results in there being no single model capable of explaining the observed phenomena. DW UMa is even more enigmatic, appearing in a previously unseen low-state during which the mass transfer rate appears to have reduced dramatically and the optical spectra are dominated by Balmer emission from the inner face of the secondary star.

In stars cooler than spectral type B helium produces only chromospheric features in the near infrared (He I lambda 10830), the ultraviolet (He II lambda 1640), and the extreme ultraviolet, however usually the He I lambda 10830 line is the only one strong enough to detect or technically feasible to observe. In addition, the experience with the Sun indicates a complex mechanism of line formation, hence few, if any, detailed model calculations have been successful. The regularly pulsating atmospheres of classical Cepheids provide a unique laboratory to study the formation of the helium spectrum in cool stars. We present high resolution high S/N spectroscopy of seven Cepheids at 1.08 \u03bcm with the FTS at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope. Three Cepheids, X Sgr, eta Aql, and zeta Gem, were observed with full phase coverage. We report the first certain detection of the He I lambda 10830 line in Cepheids. The He I lambda 10830 absorption is present at all times. Its velocity variation lags behind the photospheric lines and the cores of Ca II K and H\u03b1 . The strength of the He I lambda 10830 line is comparable to the strength of the He I lambda 10830 line in non-variable yellow supergiants on the average, and appears to depend on T_{rm eff}. We find that the He I lambda 10830 absorption is systematically blueshifted in at least four Cepheids, indicating a steady outflow in the upper chromosphere. In the analysis we apply an iterative procedure between a hydrodynamic code and a version of the non-LTE radiation transfer code MULTI. We use model atoms of H, Ca II, Mg II, and a specially constructed helium atom with 15 levels and both stages of ionization. The static model is very successful in reproducing the helium spectrum of the Sun and beta Gem. Our time-dependent modeling of pulsating Cepheid atmospheres offers additional physical insight into the results already present in the observational data. Concerning Cepheid chromospheres, we conclude that Cepheids should have chromospheres heated by acoustic or magnetic wave dissipation, in addition to the pulsation. The existence of hot coronae around Cepheids is unlikely, as judged by the height of formation of the He I lambda 10830 line in Cepheid atmospheres. Concerning the mechanism of formation of the He I lambda 10830 line, we conclude that the chromospheres of luminous stars favor collisional excitation over photoionization-recombination (due to X -ray back-radiation) to overpopulate the 2^3 S level, except for stars with very strong coronae. The flux from the wings of the Lyalpha He II lambda 304 line may play an important role for the He I lambda 10830 line in stars with less prominent coronae or none at all. Once the 2^3S level is overpopulated, the He I lambda 10830 line is formed by scattering photospheric photons (hence appears in absorption projected on the disk), a process so efficient that geometrical effects of atmospheric extension are needed to explain the He I lambda 10830 emission observed in zeta Gem.", "bibstem": ["PhDT", "PhDT"], "citation_count": 3, "pub": "Ph.D. Thesis", "[citations]": {"num_citations": 3, "num_references": 0}, "keyword_schema": ["STI category"], "keyword_norm": ["Physics: Astronomy and Astrophysics"], "year": "1990", "identifier": ["1990PhDT.......116S"], "title": ["A Study of the Helium i Lambda 10830 Line in the Atmospheres of Classical Cepheids"], "property": ["REFEREED", "PHDTHESIS"], "aff": ["UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO (CANADA)."], "id": "3602339", "pubdate": "1990-01-00", "page": ["s International, Volume: 53-02, Section: B, page: 0897"]}, {"bibcode": "1990PhDT.......113S", "author": ["Sassi, Mohamed"], "keyword": ["Astronomy"], "database": ["ASTRONOMY", "PHYSICS"], "abstract": "The objective of this work has been to develop laser spectroscopic methods to diagnose partially ionized plasmas. It is motivated by the need to increase understanding of the role of flow non-uniformities and plasma/wall interactions in plasma devices by making in-situ measurements of electric field strength, ion mobilities, concentrations and temperatures in a non-intrusive fashion that allows point-, one-, and two-dimensional imaging. We have focused on methods that are based on observing the Doppler shift in ionic spectra due to an ion drift velocity. Two particular methods we have been working with are Velocity Modulation Laser Spectroscopy (VMLS) and Two-Beam Doppler Shift Laser Spectroscopy (TBDSLS). The scientific approach has been to use conventional laser induced fluorescence (LIF) to probe ion absorption line profiles. If there is an electric field present, the ions will experience a net force and undergo drift, resulting in a shift in the position of the line profile. This shift can be related to the ion mobility or the electric field component along the probe direction if one or the other is known. Temperature and concentration can be recovered by conventional laser spectroscopic means. A well characterized, flame assisted plasma has been developed to use for investigation of the laser based spectroscopic methods. The Lawton-Weinberg theory has been used to describe the plasma. This theory predicted the shape of the plasma I/V characteristic curves from which an estimate of the ion number density and mobility could be obtained. An experimental investigation of the I/V curves of the barium seeded, flame assisted plasma, helped in establishing the optimum conditions for the laser measurements. LIF has been used to measure the absorption line profile of the barium ion. VMLS and TBDSLS were then investigated. The experimental results were used to determine a detectability limit for the LIF signal and line shift. The diagnostic is limited by signal to noise ratio rather than Doppler shift resolution. Spatially resolved LIF measurements have been made to study the ion density profiles under the action of applied electric field. The plasma temperature distribution was obtained from the LIF data using a new method of fitting single spectral line data to a Voigt profile. Both the ion density and the temperature profiles featured a parabolic distribution characterstic of a developed boundary layer. Finally, Langmuir probe measurements have been performed to estimate the plasma electric field distribution. The results of these measurements showed that a field of the order of few tens of V/cm existed in the plasma. This field is sufficient to cause a Doppler shift of the order of the line width, however, the drop in ion number density was limiting.", "bibstem": ["PhDT", "PhDT"], "pub": "Ph.D. Thesis", "[citations]": {"num_citations": 0, "num_references": 0}, "keyword_schema": ["STI category"], "keyword_norm": ["Astronomy"], "year": "1990", "identifier": ["1990PhDT.......113S"], "title": ["Laser Spectroscopy of a Flame Assisted Plasma."], "property": ["REFEREED", "PHDTHESIS"], "id": "3602225", "pubdate": "1990-01-00", "aff": ["UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY."]}, {"bibcode": "1990PhDT.......113R", "author": ["Reynolds, M.

Arsenic doped layers exhibited a p-type characteristic stable under low temperature anneal.

Dependence of the net acceptor concentration on arsine and mercury partial pressure was investigated in conjunction with SIMS analysis to study the arsenic incorporation. The incorporation of atomic arsenic was found to saturate at higher arsenic flow rates, resulting in the acceptor concentration saturating at ~10^{17 } cm^{-3}. The layers were found to exhibit negligible compensation due to the arsenic related donor. A model was presented to explain the incorporation of arsenic.

An unstable local mode consists of a group of dominant waves which jointly give rise to a maximum local energy downstream of the jet core. Its growth rate diminishes very rapidly as the constant part of the basic zonal wind is increased, but is not sensitive to the zonally averaged part of the shear flow. The non-modal analysis shows the excitation of a local mode within a few days from an initially isolated disturbance depends strongly on the initial position relative to the jet core but less strongly on the initial configuration of the isolated disturbance. A complete set of local energy equations has been formulated to reveal the nature of the various physical mechanisms of the instability of a zonally inhomogeneous basic flow. The energy redistribution processes are comparable in importance to the energy generation processes themselves. They are found to counteract one another to a great extent resulting in a net downstream intensification of a disturbance. The second part considers the problem of the mutual dependence of planetary and synoptic scale waves in the context of a high resolution, zonally forced, dissipative, two-layer quasi-geostrophic channel model. We have specifically examined the dynamical properties of the equilibrated flow in a 6000-day numerical experiment with a realistic forcing parameter. The wave field in the equilibrated state is dominated by the planetary scale wave with wavenumber (m,n) = (2,2) and the synoptic scale waves (m,n) = (4,1) and (5,1). The modified zonal flow together with the internally forced planetary scale wave may be viewed as a zonally inhomogeneous background flow upon which the synoptic scale eddies grow preferentially downstream of the planetary scale jet streams.

The thesis develops in two sections:. Part A of the thesis, found in Chapters 1-7, focuses on the impact that personal science should have on science education. In this section the diversity implied by the term \"science\" as it is presently used within science education discourse is considered and it is argued that the idea of personal science should be an essential dimension of school portrayals of science. In developing the idea of personal science a number of influential philosophies of science have been considered in light of my own experience as an astronomer and teacher. Attention is given to Holton's thematic analysis of science and Polanyi's philosophy of personal knowledge and it is argued that Polanyi's conception of personal knowledge may be used to found a more effective epistemology for science education. The problem of fostering, communicating and sharing one's personal science is addressed. The suggestion is made that a curriculum focused on one's personal experiencing of the ideas will be more effective in portraying the personal dimension of science. Narrative and story-telling are explored as effective means of communicating and sharing one's personal science. Part B of the thesis presents the results of three research projects in astronomy.

In part I, action-angle methods are applied to several problems in tokamak transport. In part II, the multiphoton excitation of atomic systems is considered. Part I begins with a development of the basic action-angle formalism used throughout this work. This is first applied to the problem of nondiffusive energetic triton losses due to MHD activity. Next the 'stochastic regime' diffusion of ions in a general ripple perturbation (finite n, m, omega) is considered. A generalized stochastic threshold is derived. We conclude by considering the diffusion of thermal and energetic particles in a turbulent spectrum. The reduction of transport due to orbit averaging is demonstrated. Also, from an observed upper bound on energetic triton diffusion in TFTR, an upper bound on the level of magnetic fluctuations is inferred. The second part of this thesis, on multiphoton atomic processes, begins with a review of this new and rapidly developing field. The intense fields typically required to drive a multiphoton transition are found to preclude a perturbative treatment. Non-perturbative methods, used throughout this work, are therefore introduced. These are first applied to the analysis of multiphoton transitions between two low lying atomic states. Comparison is made between excitation and ionization rates for specific atomic systems. The same methods are also applied to the analysis of multiphoton transitions in Rydberg atoms. Resonance conditions, transition thresholds, and ionization thresholds for such atoms are found to be in close agreement with experimental observations.", "bibstem": ["PhDT", "PhDT"], "citation_count": 7, "pub": "Ph.D. Thesis", "[citations]": {"num_citations": 7, "num_references": 0}, "keyword_schema": ["STI category"], "keyword_norm": ["Physics: Fluid and Plasma; Physics: Atomic"], "year": "1990", "identifier": ["1990PhDT.......102D"], "title": ["Topics in Action-Angle Methods Applied to Takomak Transport and Multiphoton Excitation of Atomic Systems."], "property": ["REFEREED", "PHDTHESIS"], "id": "3601630", "pubdate": "1990-01-00", "aff": ["PRINCETON UNIVERSITY."]}, {"bibcode": "1990PhDT.......100S", "author": ["Sheldon, Robert Bruce"], "keyword": ["RING CURRENT", "ENERGY LOSS", "energy", "Physics: Fluid and Plasma, Physics: Atmospheric Science, Physics: Astronomy and Astrophysics"], "database": ["ASTRONOMY"], "abstract": "We have studied the problem of ion transport and loss in the quiet terrestrial ring current, extending the energy range of the standard radial diffusion model, developed for radiation belt particles, to the ring current ions and have compared it with experimental data. We compiled a data set from all quiet days (with good local time coverage) seen by the AMPTE/CCE/CHEM instrument in near equatorial orbit at L-shells from 2-9 R<SUB>E</SUB> . For the first time, we have ionic composition information in an energy range that includes the bulk of the ring current ions, 1-300 keV/e. We used a standard radial diffusion model that incorporates a source boundary at large distances from the earth, 7.5 R_ {E}, and follows the ions as they diffuse earthward while undergoing charge exchange and Coulomb energy loss. We improved on the model loss processes by incorporating the latest atomic physics cross sections from the literature. We also employed a chi ^2 minimization routine to fit the amplitudes of the diffusion constants, but we were unable to fit the data (to within a factor of 10) over 50% of the energy -radial range of the data set. Some of the deviation from the model is explained by convection-produced, local time (LT) dependencies in the data that are ignored by the azimuthally averaged model. But even accounting for this low energy correction (<30 keV), we propose there exists an additional transport term at low L-shells (< 4.0 R<SUB>E</SUB>) that does not obey the expected L^6 power law. We argue that scattering processes are responsible for this additional transport, and suggest a collisional mechanism as a possible candidate. In addition, we develop a new model that incorporates LT variations into the radial diffusion model. This new model can be shown to handle both convection and diffusion simultaneously. It also predicts a LT-dependent radial diffusion coefficient.

In order to accurately calculate resistive instabilities for resistivities in the range of fusion reactors, it is essential to overcome the problem of numerical errors caused by terms in the eigenmode equations associated with the fast magnetosonic wave. This type of numerical error is referred to as \"spectral pollution\". A specific formulation of the linearized resistive MHD eigenmode equations has been carefully chosen on the basis of minimizing the numerical error due to spectral pollution by accurately resolving the continuum spectrum of the ideal MHD operator. The effective technique we use for eliminating spectral pollution is not limited to only working in the 1d cylindrical limit. Our formulation reduces the resistive MHD stability equations into three second order coupled equations in a manner such that one of the three equations recovers the identical formulation of the NOVA (1) code in the ideal limit. The nonvariational approach being used has already been successfully applied to the linearized ideal MHD eigenmode equations in the NOVA code. Two stability codes were developed in order to implement our formulation. The NOVA-RC stability code solves the linearized resistive MHD eigenmode equations for 1d cylindrical equilibria. The NOVA-R stability code solves the linearized resistive MHD eigenmode equations for a given axisymmetric toroidal plasma equilibrium with noncircular flux surfaces. Results from both codes are presented in order to establish their credibility. The eigenfunctions are represented by a Fourier expansion and cubic B-spline finite elements.

In this research various types and thicknesses of geomembranes were evaluated in order to determine which geomembranes could be used as suitable barriers for radon. The permeation of radioactive gases through geomembranes cannot be measured using the method described by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The ASTM method estimates the permeation of a single pure gas through a polymeric membrane. The radioactivity of radon would be very high if this method was used. The method developed in this study utilized radon permeation scintillation cell which consisted of a source chamber, a measuring chamber, a radium source, and a geomembrane specimen. The concentration of radon within the source chamber and the measuring chamber was quantified by counting the alpha particles emitted by the decay of radon and its daughters. Based on the percentage of radon permeation through the membranes (defined as the reduction factor), the permeance was calculated. The data indicated that 0.8-mm thick geomembranes such as chlorinated polyethylene, polyurethane and ethylene interpolymer alloy provided a permeance that was less than 500 fmol m^{-2}s ^{-1} Pa^{ -1}. These geomembranes are suitable barriers for radon. The permeance of 0.15-mm polyethylene sheet, which has been used as a radon barrier, is 1.47 times 10<SUP>4</SUP> fmol m^{-2}s^ {-1} Pa^{-1} . The effect of certain parameters on radon permeation was quantitatively studied. Such parameters included the difference in air pressure between the two sides of a geomembrane, the thickness of the geomembrane, and the temperature. It was found that a difference of 5 cm Hg in air pressure between the two sides of a geomembrane did not significantly influence the radon permeation. Radon permeation decreased exponentially with increasing thickness of the geomembranes. Radon permeation increased according to an exponential function as the temperature increased. The values measured for the activation energy for the permeation of radon through different geomembranes were between 26 and 110 kJ mol ^{-1}. In studies of the effect of temperature on radon permeation our results showed that the values of the activation energies and the pre-exponential factors measured for radon through a wide range of geomembranes gave very good linear plots of the activation energies and the logarithm of the pre-exponential factors.

In those atmospheres ammonia is the source of essentially all microwave opacity at levels accessible by radio methods. Unfortunately, accurate methods for calculating microwave absorptivities of gas mixtures containing ammononia under specified conditions have eluded spectroscopists for more than half a century, partly due to a lack of adequate laboratory data. A microwave spectrometer, based on a cavity resonator, was constructed to measure refractivity spectra of the transparent gases hydrogen, helium, and methane, and to measure both refractivity and absorptivity spectra on gas mixtures containing ammonia. Gas conditions included temperatures from about 210 to 320 K, pressures from 1 to 8.2 atm., and the spectra covered microwave frequencies from 9 to 18 GHz. Data on the transparent gases confirm that their density-normalized refractivities are invariant with temperature, pressure, and frequency within measurement accuracies. Refractivities are consistent with accepted values at optical frequencies: 135 x 10^{-6} for hydrogen, 35 x 10^{-6} for helium, and 440 x 10^{-6} for methane, under standard conditions. Refractivities of mixtures are linear in the partial pressures of constituent gases. Absorptivity data on mixtures containing ammonia show serious disagreements with current prediction formalisms. Van Vleck-Weisskopf theory, and Ben-Reuven theory as modified by Berge and Gulkis (1976), both fail to accurately predict observed temperature, pressure, and frequency dependences. Optimization techniques that fit a parameterized Berge and Gulkis formalism to the data produced a new formalism that more accurately predicts microwave absorption by ammonia. The new formalism predicts that at the low temperatures extant in the atmospheres of the giant planets, ammonia will be less opaque to microwaves than previously thought.

These structures have had considerable use in the study of stability. Recent advances in symplectic geometry, combined with the Liapunov technique developed by Arnold, have set the stage for new applications in nonlinear stability analysis. Arnold's method only works under smoothness assumptions on an equilibrium solution; nevertheless, generalizations of his idea to nonsmooth cases have been carried out for vortex patches and some planar Euler flows. The aim of this work is to extend the generalizations to stellar dynamics. The stellar dynamical system can be described by distribution functions f(t, x, v), (t, x, v) in IR times IR^3 times IR^3, satisfying the coupled Vlasov and Poisson equations. This system admits a Hamiltonian structure and has drawn great attention from mathematicians and astrophysicists because of its still-open global existence and nonlinear stability problems. The total energy plus a suitably chosen conserved quantity is used as the Lyapunov function in this analysis. Motivated by the positivity of a linear stability criterion in the astronomical literature, we found an a priori estimate of this Lyapunov function for the spherically symmetric stationary solutions which are decreasingly dependent on their energy. The other positivity property found in the literature is interpreted in our geometrical setting as the positive definiteness on the tangent space of the coadjoint orbit through a regular steady state solution. This paper enlarges the class of perturbed distribution functions in which the a priori estimate is valid. By choosing a suitable conserved quantity, we show that our stability result is also true for some general stationary solutions in a spherically symmetric stellar system.

The model physics includes PBL turbulent transfer, atmospheric longwave and shortwave radiation, diurnal energy budgets over ground, cloud microphysics and subgrid cumulus parameterization. The model utilizes a new fourth order Crowley advection scheme which preserves phase and amplitude much better than other Crowley schemes. Turbulence closures using the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and dissipation (varepsilon ) equations are investigated with the level 2.5 scheme of Mellor and Yamada (1982) to better determine eddy diffusivities. One-dimensional (1-D) model results show that the PBL flows under various stability conditions are not significantly sensitive to the modified Blackadar's and Kolmogorov's eddy mixing length formations, although the latter yields excessively large mixing lengths in the entrainment region of the upper PBL. With the same prognostic TKE equation, the model results show insensitivity of the 1-D flow to the details of diagnostic formulations in the closures and to eddy Prandtl numbers. A 2-D model is used to stimulate January 28 cold -air outbreak over the Gulf Stream region during the IOP -2 (Intensive Observation Period) of the 1986 Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment (GALE). The modeled 2-D circulation system is found to be sensitive to Prandtl number, in contrast to the 1-D model results. Prandtl number becomes increasingly important as the clouds begin to interact with the marine boundary layer (MBL). Using the E-varepsilon closure, the model predicts the observed MBL structure that includes a low level jet west of the Gulf Stream warm core and a constrained boundary layer height due to the middle-level stable layer. Two cases with 3-D idealized flow are also simulated for the same GALE IOP. For the easterly onshore ambient flow, a confluence zone appears near the coastline in response to the strong oceanic baroclinicity due to the Gulf Stream. With the increased coastal confluence, a shallow coastal front (below 2 km) begins to form. Stationary rainbands are produced along the coastal front. For the northerly offshore ambient flow, the rainband first appears along the eastern edge of the Gulf Stream and moves slowly downstream. The model is also applied to simulate the 3-D airflow past Taiwan mountains. For both north-westerly and the south-westerly prevailing winds (with a Froude number of about 0.3), a mesoscale low pressure center occurs at the south-eastern (downstream) slopes of the steep mountains.

The QN ringing of a black hole is of considerable interest in connection with laser interferometric gravitational -wave detectors. In the first article the theory of the excitation of ringing is formulated for perturbations to an existing black hole.

The IMB experiment, designed to study nucleon decay, is also the world's largest detector of neutrinos. The experiment uses 6800 tons (3300 tons fiducial) of water as both target and detecting medium. Relativistic charges particles traversing the water radiate Cerenkov light. The distinctive ring patterns are imaged by 2048 light collectors (each a photo-multiplier tube coupled with a wavelength-shifting plate) distributed over the surfaces of the tank. This dissertation describes the IMB-3 detector, a four-fold increase in sensitivity over the original apparatus. Neutrino interactions of both atmospheric and extragalactic origin were collected during a 3.4 kiloton-year exposure. A consequence of non-zero neutrino mass could be oscillation of neutrino flavor. The energies and long flight distances of atmospheric neutrinos offer a unique opportunity to explore this possibility. To study the composition of the atmospheric neutrinos, single-ring events are classified as showering or non-showering using the geometry of the Cerenkov pattern. A simulation of neutrino interactions and a model of atmospheric neutrino production are used to predict the composition of the sample. The showering/non-showering character of an event is strongly correlated with the flavor of its neutrino parent. In the lepton momentum range p < 1500 MeV/c, non-showering events comprise 41 +/- 3(stat.) +/- 2(syst.)% of the total. The fraction expected is 51 +/- 5(syst.)%. Although this is evidence for an anomaly in the composition of atmospheric neutrinos, the 2sigma deviation is not sufficient to require neutrino oscillations. Eight interactions recorded over a six second interval on February 23, 1987 are coincident with the discovery of Supernova 1987a. These data, together with simultaneous signals in a least one other detector, confirm transport of energy by neutrinos, a lynchpin of stellar collapse models. Prompt arrival of neutrinos from ~ 50 kiloparsec distant places many constraints on the properties of neutrinos which rival those from terrestrial experimentation. Some solutions to the missing mass or \"dark matter\" problem result in high-energy neutrino production within the Sun.

This transport of heat and mass is dominated by natural convection with buoyant forces primarily generated as a result of film heating by the solar flux, but aided by the evaporation of water (the lighter species) into the rising moist air stream. In order to better understand the mechanism of these combined buoyant interactions, the governing equations for natural convection flow in a vertical channel bounded by a heated falling film (simulating a glazed collector/regenerator) were solved using several different finite difference techniques. The numerical results were validated against existing experimental and numerical results for simplified boundary conditions. The appropriate nondimensionalization for the falling film boundary condition was established, ostensibly for the first time, and a parametric study for an air-water vapor mixture has been presented. Curve fits to the numerical results were determined for engineering design applications. To further confirm the validity of the numerical solutions, an experimental apparatus was constructed using electric resistance heat to simulate the constant heat flux of the solar source. Water was introduced at the top of this heated vertical surface at various flow rates and under various supplied heat fluxes, and a natural convection channel flow generated between the heated falling film and a parallel, plexiglass surface. Film temperatures and moist air velocity profiles were measured at various streamwise (vertical) locations for comparison with the numerical results. In general, measured film temperatures were 15 to 20 percent lower than the predicted values, but came to within 3 percent of the predictions when experimental uncertainty was incorporated into the numerical inputs. Photographic smoke-wire measurements of the induced moist air velocity were about 20 percent higher than the numerical predictions for small channel gap spacing, and about 50 percent higher for large gap spacing. These trends in the data indicate that a redistribution of the supplied heat flux from the film to the moist air is required to lower predicted film temperatures and raise predicted gas velocities.

Mixtures of CO-Ar and CO -N_2 were tested. The feasibility of pumping CO with blackbody radiation at pressures of the order of one atmosphere was demonstrated.

This state is called the preoutburst stage. A simple disk model was created in which the inner and outer radii of the line -emitting region could be adjusted. The observed changes in the dwarf novae emission line profiles were reproduced using this model. The results are consistent with a heating front moving through the disk.

A procedure for identifying periodic points and determining their movements is presented as well as how to make meaningful comparisons between periodic flows. We observe that periodic points move very much as a planetary system; planets (hyperbolic points) have moons (elliptic points) with twice the period of the planets; furthermore the spatial arrangement of periodic points becomes symmetric at regular time intervals. Detailed analyses reveal complex behavior: birth, bifurcation, and collapse of islands; formation and periodic motion of coherent structures, such as islands and large scale folds. Experimental results show that the viscoelastic systems also exhibit regular and chaotic regions, and the large scale structures--folds and symmetry--in the viscoelastic systems are remarkably similar to that of the Newtonian systems.

The motivation for the present work is to understand the potential effect of the magnetic field generated by the neutrino scattering off charged particles on the supernova explosion. For a long time, this phenomenon has been difficult to explain, despite the efforts of many theoretical astrophysicists. Earlier workers have found that magnetic fields of more than 10 <SUP>15</SUP> Gauss are needed in the supernova explosion. Our results show that the generated magnetic field is large enough (exceeding 10 <SUP>20</SUP> Gauss, provided no nonlinear effects set in, as compared with the estimated value above) to help the supernova explosion. The time scale of the acceleration of electrons by the scattering of neutrinos (10^{-2} -10^{-3} sec) is comparable to the times scale of the gravitational collapse (10 ^{-2}-10^{ -3} sec). The results also show that electrons contribute dominantly to the current generation rate. This fact led us to investigate the deceleration of electrons by heavy ions through Coulomb interaction. Our results show that the Coulomb relaxation process is inefficient because electron degeneracy suppresses the deceleration of electrons. Therefore, the current generation is still effective and the generated magnetic field is large enough to affect the supernova explosion. The finding of a source of a strong magnetic field suggests further study of the processes in the nonlinear regime. The nonlinear processes include the effect of the magnetic field on the current generation process (dynamo process); the effect of the magnetic field on the differential rotation (transport process of angular momentum), which is an essential part of the current drive; and the effect of the magnetic field on the buoyancy instability and subsequent convective motion of infalling material.

The inclusive ^6Li( pi^+,p) and exclusive ^6Li(pi^+,pp) reactions were measured at five different pion kinetic energies of 115, 140, 165, 190, and 220 MeV at the PSI laboratory. The first proton was detected by one of three DeltaE-E NaI telescopes with a 19.2 msr solid angle for each telescope. The second proton was stopped at a large acceptance (600 msr) array of plastic scintillator with two additional wire chambers. During the course of the experiment, the three NaI telescopes were fixed at the angles 35^circ, 57.5^circ, and 80 ^circ, and the plastic scintillator was moved from -30^circ to -150^circ . The angular correlations {d ^2sigmaover dOmega_1dOmega _2} and the energy sharing distributions {d^2sigmaover dOmega_1dE_1} are presented for the four different missing mass cuts: (-20,10) MeV, (10,35) MeV, (35,80) MeV, and (80,140) MeV. Agreements with the renormalized DWIA calculations are good for the low missing mass regions, (-20,10) MeV and (10,35) MeV. Our simple three-nucleon absorption model (four-body phase space simulation) seems to describe the data reasonably well for the high missing mass regions, (35,80) MeV and (80,140) MeV. For (-20,10) and (10,35) MeV excitation energies, the single differential cross section {dsigmaover dOmega_1}, which are obtained by integrating the data, have the same angular dependence as the free reaction d(pi^+,pp) at the five pion incident energies. Comparing the inclusive and exclusive measurements, the FSI corrections are found to be important. Our DWIA model employing a deuteron optical potential for the outgoing proton distortions seems to predict reasonable FSI corrections. Including other published ^6Li( pi^+,pp) data, the two-nucleon absorption cross sections on the two p-shell nucleons ( (-20,10) MeV) have the same energy dependence as the free reaction d(pi^+,pp).

The resulting tables of thermodynamic quantities cover the ranges 2.1 <=q log T (K) <=q 7.06 and - 6 <=q log rho (g/cm^3) <=q 3.75. All thermodynamic variables are derived from a Helmholtz free energy model for a mixture of atoms (H), molecules (H_2), protons, and electrons. This free energy is obtained by combining separate models for: (1) the dense atomic and molecular fluid and (2) the fully ionized plasma. In our free energy model for the atomic and molecular mixture, we use realistic potentials for the non-ideal interactions between particles. These are computed using a modified fluid perturbation theory which reproduces the results of Monte Carlo simulations to within 3%. The effect of these interactions on the internal levels of bound species is treated with a recently developed occupation probability formalism. The resulting EOS is in excellent agreement with high-pressure laboratory measurements. In the fully ionized regime, the non-ideal effects of the polarizable, strongly coupled plasma are evaluated in the framework of the semi-analytical hypernetted chain theory. The response of the strongly correlated electron gas, including exchange and correlation effects, is calculated for any degree of degeneracy in the linear response approximation. The resulting thermodynamics agree with Monte Carlo simulations to better than 1%. In the high-temperature, low-density domain, electrons and protons form a weakly coupled classical plasma. In this regime, we use the so-called Two Component Plasma model. The neutral and ionized models are combined, and the interaction between charged and neutral species is described, with a screened polarization potential. The combined model provides a description of both temperature - and pressure-ionization.

Fast track reconstruction software has been developed, which determines underground muon trajectories to ~eq{+/-}1.0^ circ. The strict quality control of data imposed prior to a physics analysis is described. After data reduction, the sample to be analysed contained 452,708 reconstructed single muon tracks. This sample has been used to investigate the possibility that the astronomical point source, Cygnus X-3, is an emitter of high energy muons. The integrated excess muon flux has been determined by using the data to calculate the expected muon rate from the source direction. A 2.1sigma overall excess has been observed within a 3^circ half-angle cone centred on the source, which corresponds to a 90% confidence level upper limit on the integrated excess flux of (2.3 +/- 0.1) times 10^{-11} cm^{-2} s^ {-1}.

A need exists to predict the action of magnetic fields on X-ray tissue doses and to identify those combinations of X-ray energies, magnetic field strengths, and tissue factors where the dose might be changed significantly from an exposure without the presence of a magnetic field. Modification of X-ray produced tissue dose arises from the ability of a strong magnetic field to induce deflections on the path of secondary electrons. In order to demonstrate the existence of this deflection, measurements were made of the relative dose distributions present within a tissue -equivalent phantom produced by exposures to X-rays and in the presence of strong magnetic fields. The dose measurements were made using radiographic film detectors, sandwiched within a polystyrene target phantom irradiated in the presence of different magnetic field intensities. The fields were oriented transversely to the direction of the incident X-ray beam. Optical densities of the film exposures were converted to equivalent tissue doses for comparison to the predictions of a semi-analytical relative dose model for the process. This model was a combination of the electron Continuous Slowing Down Approximation, modified to account for multiple scattering, and a exponential photon dose model. As a result of this work, it was found that: (1) strong magnetic fields in the range of 1.2 to 5 T can induce changes in the tissue distribution of X-ray produced dose to small volumes in excess of 10%, (2) the region of maximum dose may be displaced significantly from the undeflected target volume, and (3) a reasonable estimate of the magnitude of these changes can be predicted, if the X-ray energy distribution and magnetic flux density are known. Such changes in deposited doses may be clinically significant and should be taken into account in treatment planning, when appropriate.

One hypothesis consistent with all of the models is that images A and B are not related by linear magnification because the source is evolving on a time scale comparable to or shorter than the time delay between images. Models not required to be consistent with linear magnification were not.

The height, geographic, and time coverage includes most of the middle atmosphere (100 mb to.1 mb), almost the entire globe (64 S to 84 N), and late October 1978 to late May 1979. The resolution (~5.5 km vertically, and a single horizontal Nyquist wavelength of 144 km) is sufficient to capture those scales of middle atmosphere gravity waves which dominate the temperature spectrum. The inertio-gravity wave signal is defined by differencing profiles of total state temperatures and globally mapped planetary waves. These residual temperature profiles are characterized by growth with height (amplitude e-folding scales ~ 25 km), and strong correlation between adjacent profiles (decorrelation lengths ~1000 km). These characteristics are consistent with an inertio -gravity wave interpretation. Higher frequency gravity waves are excluded from the LIMS temperature data by radiative transfer effects. The inertio-gravity wave signals are quantified further by examining residual temperature variance, vertical spectra, and horizontal spectra. The variance shows intriguing though largely empirical relationships with the background winds. A strong correlation in time and space is seen between the LIMS inertio-gravity wave variance and the total gravity wave forcing inferred indirectly from the mapped large scale atmosphere. This correlation implies that inertio-gravity waves may be dominating the total gravity wave momentum transport in the lower to middle mesosphere. An alternative interpretation is that the inertio-gravity wave distribution is the same as that of the high frequency gravity waves, which both theory and ground-based observations indicate are important in the momentum budget of the mesosphere. The vertical inertio -gravity wave spectra are variable in shape, being red in winter but showing pronounced long wavelength rollover in the tropics and during summer. The inertio-gravity wave horizontal spectra are truly universal in shape, with slight rollover at long wavelength (>=q3000 km), very nearly like k_sp{H} {-5/3} at intermediate wavelengths, and slight flattening due to aliasing at short wavelengths (<=q1000 km). Horizontal spectra of the inverted temperature profiles are also examined. Such profiles contain signals of both inertio-gravity waves and planetary waves, but allow direct comparison with other high horizontal resolution measurements of the middle atmosphere.

The GREX array was built for high resolution (<1 ^circ) searches of PeV gamma-ray point sources. The muon content of showers detected between 1st October 1988 and 30th September 1989 from the direction of Cygnus X-3 was analysed with the hope that evidence for PeV gamma -ray emission would be found by the selection of muon poor showers. No evidence for emission was found by selecting muon poor showers, however weak evidence for emission pulsed with the 4.8 hr period of Cygnus X-3 was seen when muon rich showers were selected. The phase of emission (0.25 -0.30) and the muon rich nature of the showers is in agreement with previous observations by other groups. If the weak evidence for emission is accepted the muon rich nature of the showers is difficult to understand. The muon observations were also used to study the mass of the primary cosmic rays in the PeV region. Measurements of the elongation rate (the rate of increase in the depth of shower maximum with primary energy) in the 1-100 PeV region indicate a decrease in the average primary mass with energy, Linsley and Fichtel (1985). Such a decrease should be accompanied by a flattening of the relation between muon number and shower size (a reduced value of alpha in the relation N_\u03bc ~ N _{rm e}^alpha). A reduction in alpha is not seen by most groups, contradicting the elongation rate measurements. This disparity was investigated experimentally. The elongation rate was determined indirectly through the variation with primary energy and atmospheric depth of the ratio of the densities in adjacent muon and unshielded deep water Cerenkov detectors (rho_mu/rho _{rm c}). An elongation rate of 122(+/-15) g/cm^2 per decade of energy was obtained for the region 0.5 to 4 PeV, in significant agreement with the results of other groups. The relation between the muon and electromagnetic components of detected showers was determined through the relation rho_mu~ rho_{rm c}^beta . Above 16 PeV beta has been measured at Haverah Park as 0.94. The present observations give beta = 0.82(+/- 0.01) in the energy range 0.5 to 4 PeV.

In addition to the \"main\" shock, which forms as the radially pulsating surface of the Mira moves outward and is observed to travel out through atmosphere, a \"preliminary\" shock structure forms as rebounding layers of the atmosphere fall back onto lower layers. The preliminary shock remains deep in the atmosphere until overrun by the outward-moving main shock. The energy dissipated by the preliminary shock usually exceeds that dissipated by the main shock, and has important effects on the light curve. The dynamic atmosphere models exhibit radial extension of the atmosphere and post-shock emission that alter the limb function (limb darkening/brightening) of the models. The effects on stellar angular diameters measured by lunar occultation technique are calculated. The results show that the usual procedure of fitting occultation observations assuming a uniform brightness disk and then correcting the resulting diameter for limb darkening can give erroneous results. The dynamic effects cause Miras to appear larger and cooler than they actually are. A post-shock relaxation zone code developed by J. N.

In this thesis, data obtained on the petrography, chemistry and isotopic compositions of CAI, identified in the carbonaceous chondrite Allende, are used as tracers to address several specific questions: (1) What are the relationships between fine and coarse-grained CAI?

Isotopic data were obtained by thermal ionization and ion microprobe mass spectrometry for individual grains within both fine and coarse-grained CAI, and correlated with petrographic and chemical observations. Evidence is presented for the enrichment of fine-grained inclusions in the lighter isotopes of Mg, in contrast to coarse-grained CAI, which are enriched in the heavier isotopes. Isotopic heterogeneity was observed within both fine and coarse -grained inclusions. Heterogeneity is discussed in the context of primary and secondary phases, mineral alteration processes, and isotopic reequilibration. A new class of coarse-grained inclusion, characterized by a distinct purple color and high spinel contents ( >=q50%), were identified and found to exhibit a high frequency (20%) of FUN isotopic anomalies. Four new FUN inclusions were identified and studied in detail. The correlated isotopic fractionation for Mg, Si, and Cr in these inclusions, suggests the importance of volatility -controlled formation processes. A model is presented for the evoluation of FUN inclusions, involving distillation of ordinary chondritic material, with a mass loss of around 70%, followed by exchange with isotopically normal reservoirs.

The focus of the study is the high temperature (800^circC to 1000^circC) equilibrium defect structure. The majority defects are described in terms of the 'LiNbO_3-ilmenite' defect model previously presented (26). Here the emphasis is placed on quantifying the defect concentrations. Congruent LiNbO_3 is highly nonstoichiometric. The large concentration of ionic defects present are mobile and contribute to electrical conduction. The ionic conduction was separated from the total conduction using defect chemistry and the transference number thus obtained was checked against the transference number obtained in a galvanic cell measurement. LiNbO_3 is an insulator (band gap = 4 eV). Hence one assumes that almost all of the conduction electrons are created by reduction. The degree of oxygen nonstoichiometry, a measure of the extent of chemical reduction, and the electron concentrations, were quantified as a function of oxygen partial pressure and the temperature by coulometric titration. The nonstoichiometry thus obtained was compared with nonstoichiometry obtained by TGA measurements. By fixing the phase composition of the sample in a buffered system, a set of constant composition measurements could be undertaken. These constant composition measurements were used to obtain the enthalpy of formation of conduction electrons, 1.95 eV, and the hopping energy for their motion at elevated temperatures, 0.55 eV, independently. The sum of the two energies was obtained by measuring the temperature dependence of the electronic conduction. The sum of the energies was found to be in excellent agreement with the energy obtained from equilibrium conduction.

The spectra of magnetic fluctuations in the frequency range 1.7 to 12 mHz observed by ISEE 1 and 2 during the growth phase of a substorm (onset at 1522 UT, April 24, 1979) have been related to this magnetotail model. It is shown that these spectra are consistent with (1) fluctuations being due to waves in the plasma sheet, (2) a magnetosheath source for the waves, (3) acoustic propagation in the lobe and (4) a nearby local Alfven wave resonance, where the wave phase velocity along the field matches the local Alfven speed. Resonant Alfven wave heating of the plasma sheet boundary layer is estimated from the model to be of the order of 1 mu W/m^2 . The absorption of this energy flux can account for a significant fraction of the observed increase in the plasma sheet temperature during the substorm. The resonant Alfven wave heating effect is modified by the presence of a component of the ambient magnetic field along the density gradient. While the total magnitude of the heating is only marginally affected, it is shown that the heating is distributed over a larger portion of the PSBL. Furthermore, based on a simple geometrical effect, this configuration allows the plasma to absorb energy from the parallel component of the Poynting flux.

The experiment with the SPS was an international collaborative effort, whose purpose was to determine the feasibility of reconstructing muon trajectories in the ocean from measurements, with a sparse array of photomultipliers, of the Cerenkov light from the muons. The successful measurement of the angular distributions and vertical fluxes at several ocean depths by reconstructing muon trajectories from the photomultipler signals demonstrates the feasibility of DUMAND (Deep Underwater Muon And Neutrino Detector). DUMAND will be a large array of photomultipliers anchored to the bottom of the ocean and used to detect the resulting Cerenkov light from high energy muons produced by the neutrino charged current interactions. The search for sources of very high energy neutrinos in the universe will be DUMAND's primary goal. This technique for reconstructing the muon has been successfully applied in several previous experiments with much more closely spaced detectors and with sensitive volumes several orders of magnitude smaller than required by DUMAND. Moreover, the backgrounds from bioluminescence and from <SUP>40</SUP>K decay in the ocean present a very different set of problems for this extension of the technique. The results presented here show that this technique remains practical despite these additional problems. The SPS, which was the first stage of DUMAND, was a vertical string of seven Cerenkov detectors tethered to a ship. The detector achieved an average effective area of 322 +/- 64m^2 . The experiment was performed at the DUMAND site. Muons were successfully detected and reconstructed at depths ranging from 2km to 4km at 500m intervals. The average effective area and the associated muon rate at the respective depths give fluxes consistent with the previous measurements at comparable depths and with the present theories of energy loss.

Direct numerical simulations are also used to study the sensitivity of a compressible wake to (1) phase effects and (2) two- and three-dimensional subharmonics. A linear stability analysis shows that the influence of increasing Mach number is stabilizing, resulting in reduced growth rates for both antisymmetric and symmetric modes of the wake. This reduction is due to baroclinic and dilatational effects as revealed from the linear eigenfunctions. For both low and high Mach numbers, the least stable wave is a two-dimensional antisymmetric mode aligned with the streamwise direction. Direct numerical simulations of a temporally-evolving wake were performed using a spectral collocation method. The results of two-dimensional simulations show that, for high Mach numbers, the same mechanisms responsible for the reduced growth rates from linear stability theory are also responsible for the delay in the roll-up of vortices. Two-dimensional simulations were also performed to study the effect of phase angle on the development of a subharmonic in a low Mach number wake. Three-dimensional simulations were performed to study the effect of phase angle between a fundamental and a pair of oblique waves on the development of the large -scale structures in a wake.

Time variation of spacecraft-measured high-latitude electric and perturbation magnetic fields is difficult to distinguish from spatial structuring that has been Doppler -shifted to a non-zero frequency in the spacecraft frame.

The radiation field is taken to be Comptonized bremsstrahlung. The pairs are assumed to be heated by Coulomb interaction with the much hotter protons and to cool by bremsstrahlung emission, Compton scattering and annihilation. Two parameters, the 'proton optical depth' and the compactness, characterize each equilibrium state. First the stability of the pair equilibria in a spherical plasma cloud is considered. It is shown that a careful account of the energy balance is very important when the stability properties are determined. The equilibria are found to be unstable in a very limited range of compactness and proton optical depth. It is concluded that this particular instability is unlikely to be the cause of the observed variability of the compact sources. The same result also implies that it is possible to build up high pair densities by a thermal mechanism in two temperature environments. The most important result of this thesis considers the effects of pairs on the structure of geometrically and effectively optically thin accretion disks. A new approach for solving for the equilibrium structure of the disks is presented. It takes full advantage of the simplicity of the disk structure equations and reduces the problem to that of considerations of the microphysics only. In effect, the pair equilibrium states are projected into the space spanned by the disk structure parameters. This allows a direct visualization of all possible disk solutions at once. Each solution profile needs to be calculated only once and a complete disk solution is obtained by a simple radial coordinate transformation. The disk solutions are thus seen to be scale free in terms of the radial coordinate as well as in terms of the mass of the central object and the accretion rate. Two particular disk solutions obtained in this way are given. It is shown that including electron -positron pairs in the disk structure calculations leads to a breakdown of the thin disk assumptions and that a more detailed disk modeling is required before electron -positron pairs can be self-consistently included.", "bibstem": ["PhDT", "PhDT"], "citation_count": 1, "pub": "Ph.D. Thesis", "[citations]": {"num_citations": 1, "num_references": 0}, "keyword_schema": ["STI category"], "keyword_norm": ["Physics: Astronomy and Astrophysics"], "year": "1990", "identifier": ["1990PhDT........68B"], "title": ["A Study of Electron-Positron Pair Equilibria in Models of Compact x- and Gamma-Ray Sources"], "property": ["REFEREED", "PHDTHESIS"], "id": "3600054", "pubdate": "1990-01-00", "aff": ["UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN."]}, {"bibcode": "1990PhDT........67L", "author": ["Luu, Jane"], "keyword": ["ASTEROIDS", "minor planets;asteroids", "Physics: Astronomy and Astrophysics"], "database": ["ASTRONOMY"], "abstract": "Recent observations indicate that comet nuclei and certain asteroids, particularly the near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and the distant asteroids, may have much in common. We have investigated the possible connection between comets and asteroids via two methods: (1) We performed a spectroscopic survey of two groups of asteroids that may be related to comets, namely the near-Earth asteroids and Trojan asteroids. This analysis is the first to make use of a homogeneous set of high quality high resolution asteroid spectra. Selection effects that particularly influence NEA observations (such as phase-reddening and albedo bias) are also examined and taken into account. The NEA survey indicates that we cannot dispel the hypothesis of a main belt origin for NEAs, while the Trojan survey shows that the Trojans and the known comet nuclei are spectrally similar over the wavelengths examined. (2) We sought a more quantitative distinction between comets and asteroids; the current distinction, the presence of a coma, is not satisfactory since it is a qualitative (as opposed to a quantitative) criterion. To achieve this goal, we attempted to determine the mass loss rates of NEAs. There was no compelling evidence for mass loss in the 11 observed NEAs, but upper limits to NEA mass loss rates were obtained using a simple model. These results do not exclude the possibility that there exist low-activity comets in the NEA population which escape detection because their small sizes result in mass loss rates which are below our detection limit. Thus whether an object is classified as comet or asteroid may ultimately depend on its size. This work suggests that the current criteria for distinguishing between comets and asteroids, and possibly our current understanding of small bodies of the solar system, may need to be revised.

These were (1) the structure of the earth and the thickness of its crust, (2) the age of the earth, and (3) the astronomical and physical causes of glacial epochs, or ice ages. This thesis concentrates on a particular interdisciplinary approach to these problems that explicitly sought to apply the techniques and methods of mathematical physics to the concerns of geology. The result was a new strand of applied mathematics and physics of the earth that was denominated 'physical geology' or 'terrestrial physics,' and eventually 'geophysics.' The thesis analyzes the mathematical foundations of this new strand and its evolving relationship with the parent disciplines, culminating in the transformation of the new field in the hands of Sir George Darwin, son of Charles, through his own brand of applied mathematics. The central historiographical aim is to analyze the dynamics of controversy and its role in the formation of the new discipline of geophysics. The origins of the field are traced to the researches of William Hopkins (c. 1840) on the phenomenon of precession to determine the thickness of the earth's crust. These are followed through to the 1860s research program of William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) in terrestrial physics, wherein various concerns were tied together, notably the effective tidal rigidity of the earth and arguments to limit the earth's age, especially on the basis of tidal retardation. George Darwin's mathematical program, sparked by efforts to use polar wandering to explain glacial epochs, elaborated an entire theory of tidal evolution that explained the earth's physical history, including the obliquity of the ecliptic and the fissipartition of the moon. By the mid-1880s Darwin had bound together all three of the interdisciplinary problems in a sophisticated approach that transformed the nascent field into modern geophysics, albeit with a distinctly British and astronomical flavor.", "bibstem": ["PhDT", "PhDT"], "pub": "Ph.D. Thesis", "[citations]": {"num_citations": 0, "num_references": 0}, "keyword_schema": ["STI category"], "keyword_norm": ["History of Science, Geophysics, Physics: Astronomy and Astrophysics"], "year": "1990", "identifier": ["1990PhDT........66K"], "title": ["The Emergence of Geophysics in Nineteenth Century Britain."], "property": ["REFEREED", "PHDTHESIS"], "id": "3599965", "pubdate": "1990-01-00", "aff": ["PRINCETON UNIVERSITY."]}, {"bibcode": "1990PhDT........66H", "author": ["Honeycutt, David Carl"], "keyword": ["HYPERSPACE", "Physics: General, Mathematics, Physics: Astronomy and Astrophysics"], "database": ["ASTRONOMY"], "abstract": "Einstein's theory of General Relativity describes spacetime under the assumption that it is four dimensional.

On surfaces under barriers, the potentials are regulated by the self-consistency between barriers and the net charging current. When the potential under the barrier goes more positive, the barrier height increases. On other hand, a stronger barrier suppresses more outgoing electrons so that net current become more negative. When the a negative charge accumulates on the surface, the barrier would decrease. These two opposite tendencies are balanced if the barrier height reaches an appropriate value. After the potential on the barrier free surfaces and barrier structures are determined, the complete potential contours around a satellite can be solved. The differential potential can be separated into a \"normalized potential\" and a scale factor. The scale factor is the most negative potential on the barrier free surface which includes all the information about ambient plasma, time, and material. The normalized potential shows the ratio between the potential at any given location and the most negative potential. It indicates the relative differential charging which is an intrinsic property of the geometry.

Here, each element in the feed array is considered individually and its diffraction pattern from the subreflector is computed by GTD. The field contributions from all elements are superimposed at the curved main reflector surface, and a physical optics integration is performed to obtain the secondary pattern. Beam-waveguide-fed Cassegrain reflector (BFCR) antennas are increasingly being used in space communication applications. Using a shooting and bouncing ray approach based on geometrical optics and aperture integration, the far-field pattern of the BFCR is calculated. This method is computationally efficient and is not restricted by the number of reflecting surfaces in the antenna configuration. The diffraction loss in the beam waveguide structure is calculated separately by the conventional near-field physical optics integration.

This requires the development of special experimental techniques with respect to low pressure plasma environments, but results in the ability to measure, independently of the thermodynamic state of the plasma, quantities such as electron temperatures and current densities. These are of primary importance for the description of the interface between a thermal arc and a bounding surface. Part I reports and discusses the experimental study of plasma surface interactions in two standard arc configurations. In Section I.A., the anode boundary layer of a free-burning arc is investigated. This configuration is of direct interest to TIG welding applications, but the results are of value in the broader area of electrode design for arc plasma generators. Quantitative values for the electron temperatures and peak current densities are presented. A consistent picture of the transport mechanisms dominating the anode boundary layer is proposed which affords predictive capabilities. In Section I.B., the near-wall region of a wall-stabilized arc is investigated by means of a double floating probe. A theoretical relationship is derived for the probe current-voltage characteristics under nonuniform plasma conditions. Electron temperature profiles are obtained near the wall, where strong deviations from equilibrium occur and impair spectrometric methods most seriously. In Part II, some modeling issues are tackled. Section II.A points out and corrects some inconsistencies in the formulation of the energy equation for a LTE plasma. In Section II.B, a collisional-radiative model for the excitation/ionization kinetics is coupled to the conservation equations allowing for deviations from LTE in a fully developed arc column. These sections provide an essential connection between the interpretation of the experimental results presented in Part I and the available experimental and computational information regarding thermal arcs.

The major energy-conservation opportunities associated with waste heat are systematically examined both physically and in terms of cost. The opportunities at the Study Refinery are systematically examined in detail. The presentation begins with an overview of the processes carried out in contemporary petroleum refineries including discussion of typical energy use. There follows a brief thermodynamic description of refinery energy flows with an emphasis on heat and on energy-efficiency analysis. The heart of the thesis is Chapters 3-5 describing heat recovery opportunities involving, respectively: extraction and use of heat from combustion gases being discharged through stacks, the exchange of heat between product streams, and uses for low-temperature waste heat. In Chapter 6, a unifying economic concept is introduced (with details in the Appendix): a \"supply curve\" for saved energy. This describes the potential rate of energy savings in barrels of oil-equivalent per year (in analogy with production capacity of oil or gas fields), as a function of the cost of saved energy in dollars per barrel (in analogy with the production cost of energy). The nature of the distribution is, of course, for the cost of saved energy to increase with increasing energy savings. In this chapter, estimates are presented for the energy conservation opportunities other than waste heat at the Study Refinery. All the opportunities are then summarized in a single supply curve. The extraordinary result in a cost-effective opportunity to reduce refinery energy use by some 26% at 1984 prices. This translates into roughly a 1 energy-cost reduction per 42-gallon barrel of petroleum input. Of course, investments are required; the net benefit would be about 1.5 cents per gallon of product. This would be a major benefit in relation to typical refinery earnings.

Comparison of nighttime results from three experimental campaigns at Arecibo covering a wide range (summer, winter and transition from solar minimum to solar maximum) of ionospheric conditions with a two dimension transport code demonstrate that nonlinear refraction of the HF beam is the major factor in production of the observed large perturbations (delta T_{rm e}/T _{rm eo}~ 3, deltan_{rm e}/n_{rm eo} ~ 25%).

The hodoscope consisted of 13 telescopes, four of these telescopes were designed to isotopically resolve fragments with 3 <=q Z <=q 10 and the other nine to resolve hydrogen and helium isotopes. In order to optimize the excitation energy resolution of the hodoscope, each telescope contained an x - y position sensitive gas proportional counter.

For the alpha-decay channels of the particle unstable ^{rm 10}B nucleus produced in the reaction, an excitation energy resolution of about 50 keV (FWHM) was achieved. Experimental population probabilities of particle -unstable states were extracted by fitting the coincidence spectra of the decay products by an appropriate R -matrix or Breit-Wigner formalism. According to thermal models, the populations of excited states at freezeout are expected to follow a Boltzmann distribution weighted by the emission temperature of the system. Tests of this freezeout assumption were made by comparing the experimental population to the predictions of statistical calculations. Extensive statistical calculations which include the effect of sequential feeding from heavier particle unstable nuclei were performed to estimate the population probabilities of the states starting with a thermal distribution of primary fragments at an initial temperature, T _{rm em}. A global comparison of the measured and calculated population probabilities and the ratios of population probabilities indicate emission temperatures of about 3-4 MeV.

The flow reactor at Princeton provides detailed intermediate and product stable species data useful for understanding the high temperature reaction mechanisms of fuels. Radical species concentrations are desired; however, their detection in the flow reactor is difficult relative to their measurement in flames. The dilute operation of the flow reactor and its lower temperature lead, for example, to peak hydroxyl radical concentrations estimated to be much lower than in ordinary flames. In addition, the flow reactor has severely limited optical access. To overcome these constraints and measure radical species concentrations along the longitudinal axis of the reactor, a unique 180^circ laser induced fluorescence probe has been developed and calibrated with line-of-sight laser absorption measurements. Hydroxyl radical concentrations measurements in moist carbon monoxide oxidation in the flow reactor have been made at initial temperatures of 989, 1053 and 1115 K and the laser induced fluorescence probe and absorption measurements indicate peak OH concentrations of 10, 25, and 51 ppm.

The first problem is studied based on Wilkinson eigenstructure perturbation analysis for covariance matrices. The second problem is formulated as an optimal Toeplitz approximation problem for observed covariance matrices with constraints including matrix definiteness and matrix rank. For performance analysis, compact formulas for the expectation of products of linear functionals of a complex Gaussian vector and the expectation of products of bilinear forms of a complex Wishart matrix are derived. Applications of the formulas to multivariate statistics are demonstrated, including the calculation of the moments of complex Wishart distributions as well as the moments of Blackman-Tukey's power spectrum estimates. The performance analysis is conducted for small -sample conditions. The analysis predicts that the bias absolute value and the variance of direction-of-arrival estimation for MUSIC are inversely proportional to signal -to-noise ratio and the number of snapshots. The prediction errors are shown to be within 3 dB based on Monte Carlo simulations. For optimal Toeplitzation, it is shown that the usual unbiased estimates of autocorrelation lags in spectrum estimation coincide with the entries of unconstrained least -squares Toeplitz approximates of observed covariance matrices. For matrix positive definiteness, the constrained optimal Toeplitz approximation problem is reduced to an unconstrained problem with a follow-up linear test using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for the unconstrained solution. For nonnegative definiteness, an optimization problem constrained by a set of linear inequalities is proposed, whose solution, if it exists, is a suboptimal solution of the nonnegative definite optimal Toeplitz approximation problem. Two methods, AP and RQ Toeplitzation, for rank constrained problems are proposed.

The degree of equivalence is evaluated between the typical quasi-static approach and a newly-developed iterative tandem method. Four specific PWR transients that exhibit a wide range of Reactor Coolant System (RCS) T/H response were investigated: (1) a Station Blackout Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS), (2) a Loss of Feedwater ATWS, (3) a Total Loss of RCS Flow with Scram, and (4) a Main Steam Line Break (MSLB). Rather than using simplified RCS and core models, the theory and method in this thesis were applied practically by using realistic models for an actual four-loop Westinghouse PWR plant. The time-dependent STAR kinetics code, based on the QUANDRY Analytic Nodal Method, and the RETRAN and MCPWR T/H systems codes were used to develop a new, fully coupled, tandem STAR/MCPWRQ methodology that runs tandemly on an enhanced 386/387 IBM PC architecture. MCPWRQ uses externally calculated power input rather than point kinetics power level results. The tandem method was compared to quasi -static STAR and time-dependent STAR 2-D and 3-D kinetics results. The new STAR/MCPWRQ method uses RETRAN time-dependent T/H and point kinetics power input as a first estimate. STAR and MCPWRQ are used tandemly to couple STAR 3-D, time-dependent core power results with the MCPWRQ RCS T/H phenomena. This thesis shows that: (a) quasi-static and point kinetics methods are not able to describe severe PWR transient phenomena adequately; and (b) fully coupled, 3-D, time -dependent, tandem (or possibly parallel) analysis methods should be used for PWR reactor transients instead. By tandemly coupling the RCS response in terms of updated core inlet conditions with 3-D time-dependent core kinetics response, the core power response and T/H conditions are forced to be self-consistent during the entire transient. The transient analyses show that a time-dependent, 3-D method is needed when non-equilibrium conditions exist in either the RCS T/H or core neutronic behavior. In general, the quasi-static approach predicts the nodal power distributions incorrectly. Point kinetics and quasi-static methods should be used only after a thermal -hydraulically coupled, time-dependent 3-D neutronics tandem method has been used to validate such simplifying approximations.", "bibstem": ["PhDT", "PhDT"], "pub": "Ph.D. Thesis", "[citations]": {"num_citations": 0, "num_references": 0}, "keyword_schema": ["STI category"], "keyword_norm": ["Astronomy"], "year": "1990", "identifier": ["1990PhDT........48F"], "title": ["Evaluation of Nodal Reactor Physics Methods for Quasi-Static and Time-Dependent Coupled Neutronic Thermal - Analysis of Pressurized Water Reactor Transients"], "property": ["REFEREED", "PHDTHESIS"], "id": "3598615", "pubdate": "1990-01-00", "aff": ["COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY."]}, {"bibcode": "1990PhDT........47E", "author": ["Emanuelsen, P. -I."], "pubdate": "1990-01-00", "database": ["ASTRONOMY"], "aff": ["-"], "bibstem": ["PhDT", "PhDT"], "citation_count": 1, "pub": "Ph.D. Thesis", "[citations]": {"num_citations": 1, "num_references": 0}, "property": ["REFEREED", "PHDTHESIS"], "year": "1990", "identifier": ["1990PhDT........47E"], "id": "3598555"}, {"bibcode": "1990PhDT........45S", "author": ["Simon, Jonathan Zev"], "keyword": ["Cosmology", "Gravitation", "Perturbation Theory", "Quantum Theory", "Relativity", "String Theory", "Approximation", "Correction", "Derivation", "Stability", "Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics"], "database": ["ASTRONOMY", "PHYSICS"], "abstract": "Higher derivative theories are frequently avoided because of undesirable properties, yet they occur naturally as corrections to general relativity and cosmic strings.

A two-and-one-half-dimensional (21over2 -D) electromagnetic particle simulation model with a driven inflow boundary and an open outflow boundary is developed for the present study. The driven inflow boundary is featured with a driving electric field for the vector potential, while the open outflow boundary is characterized by a vacuum force free condition for the electrostatic potential. The major findings are as follows. (1) The simulations exhibit both quasi-steady single X-line reconnection (SXR) and intermittent multiple X line reconnection (MXR). The MXR process is characterized by repeated formation and convection of magnetic islands (flux tubes or plasmoids). (2) Particle acceleration in the MXR process occurs mainly in O line regions as particles are trapped within magnetic islands, not in X line regions. The MXR process results in a power law particle energy spectrum of f(E)~ E ^{-4}. (3) Field-aligned particle heat fluxes and intense plasma waves associated with the collisionless magnetic reconnection process are also observed. (4) When applied to the dayside magnetopause, simulation results show that the MXR process tends to generate a simultaneous magnetic field perturbation on both sides of the dayside magnetopause, resembling the observed features of two-regime flux transfer events (FTEs). (5) An intrusion of magnetosheath plasma bulge into the magnetosphere due to the formation of magnetic islands may lead to the layered structures observed in magnetospheric FTEs.
